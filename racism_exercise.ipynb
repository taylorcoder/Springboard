    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",

    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "+ The extremely small p-value for the permutation hypothesis test suggests that the null hypothesis is false. In other words, the sound, in terms of race, of a person's name, does seem to have some bearing on whether or not that person receives a request for an interview. \n",
    "+ The 95% confidence interval we constructed from the difference in sample proportions suggests similarly. A difference of 0, where the true proportions of white versus black sounding names that received requests are the same, does not even appear in the confidence interval. Therefore, we are confident that on average, the proportion of white-sounding names that receive requests is larger than the proportion of black-sounding names that receive requests. \n",
    "+ However, these results DO NOT imply that race/name is the most important factor in callback success. It only implies that the two factors seem to be related. If we wanted to discover the most important factors, we might consider observing the correlation coefficient matrix of all of the variables, and running further hypothesis testing on those values that seem signficantly large."
